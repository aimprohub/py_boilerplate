        <p>
          Selecting the right element and providing the right visual styles is
          the basis of <a href="https://do.co/community">writing CSS</a> code.
          Whenever you need to adjust how an element on a webpage looks, using
          selectors is key.

        <h2 class="style-1 color-1 color-2">The Type Selector</h2>
        <p>
          The type selector finds elements on the page by tag name. This is a
          common way to style elements on the page. Type selectors are often
          referred to as element selectors.

        <h2 class="style-1 color-3">Combining Selectors</h2>
        <p>
          A combinator selector is defined by a space character between
          selectors, with the HTML ancestry reading left to right. The
          right-most selector is the intended target. This can be as complex or
          as simple as necessary to <em>scope</em>, or provide sufficient
          specificity, to the intended element.
